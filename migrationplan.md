## Notes and Decisions

**Database Migration Notes**:

- Consider using pgAdmin or similar tool to analyze existing schema
- Document any custom PostgreSQL functions that may need adaptation
- Plan for incremental migration if the database is large

**Backend API Notes**:

- Evaluate Express.js vs. Next.js API routes for certain functionality
- Consider implementing a layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories)
- Use zod or similar for runtime type validation

**Frontend Notes**:

- Consider using a component library compatible with Tailwind (Headless UI, Radix)
- Evaluate React Query vs. SWR for data fetching
- Plan component structure based on atomic design principles

**Authentication Notes**:

- Determine if JWT or session-based auth is more appropriate
- Consider MFA requirements
- Plan for token refresh strategy

**Deployment Notes**:

- Consider setting up a staging environment first
- Implement database backup strategy before going live
- Plan for monitoring and observability
