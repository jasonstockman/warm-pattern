# Monitoring and Operations Guide

This document outlines the monitoring setup and operational procedures for the Warm Pattern application.

## Monitoring Setup

### Application Monitoring

#### Backend Monitoring (Railway)

1. **Logs**
   - Railway provides built-in logging for your application
   - Access logs via the Railway dashboard under your project's "Deployments" tab
   - Filter logs by timestamp, service, or deployment

2. **Health Checks**
   - Implement a `/health` endpoint in your API
   - Configure Railway to periodically ping this endpoint
   - Set up alerts for failed health checks

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage in Railway dashboard
   - Track response times using Railway metrics

#### Frontend Monitoring (Vercel)

1. **Web Vitals**
   - Enable Vercel Analytics to track Core Web Vitals
   - Monitor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Integrate Sentry or similar tool for frontend error tracking
   - Add to your Next.js application:

   ```javascript
   // In _app.js or _app.tsx
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: "your-sentry-dsn",
     environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
   });
   ```

3. **User Analytics**
   - Consider adding Google Analytics or Plausible for user behavior tracking
   - Monitor page views, navigation patterns, and conversion metrics

### Database Monitoring (Supabase)

1. **Dashboard Metrics**
   - Monitor database size, connections, and usage in Supabase dashboard
   - Track API usage and quotas

2. **Performance**
   - Monitor query performance and slow queries
   - Set up PostgreSQL query logging for debugging

3. **Backups**
   - Configure automated backups in Supabase
   - Verify backup integrity periodically

## Alerting Setup

### Critical Alerts

Configure alerts for critical issues:

1. **Service Outages**
   - Set up Railway and Vercel notifications for deployment failures
   - Configure alerts for sustained high error rates

2. **Database Issues**
   - Monitor for connection issues to Supabase
   - Alert on database space reaching capacity

3. **Authentication Problems**
   - Monitor for spikes in authentication failures
   - Alert on unusual authentication patterns

### Notification Channels

Configure multiple notification channels:

1. Email alerts for non-urgent issues
2. SMS/phone for critical outages
3. Slack/Discord integration for team communication

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups

1. **Automated Backups**
   - Supabase provides daily automated backups
   - Retain backups for at least 30 days

2. **Manual Backups**
   - Schedule weekly manual backups before major releases
   - Export critical data monthly for offline storage

3. **Backup Testing**
   - Periodically test backup restoration process
   - Document restoration procedures and test them quarterly

### Application Backups

1. **Code Repository**
   - Ensure GitHub repository has proper backup
   - Consider mirroring to a secondary Git provider

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Securely store copies of all environment variables
   - Document all external service credentials

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Plan

1. **Service Disruption**
   - Document step-by-step recovery procedures for each service
   - Maintain current contact information for service providers

2. **Data Loss**
   - Define procedures for database restoration
   - Document point-in-time recovery process for Supabase

3. **Security Incident**
   - Create procedures for responding to security breaches
   - Define steps for credential rotation and service isolation

### Recovery Time Objectives

Define and document:
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Maximum acceptable downtime
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss

## Regular Maintenance

### Update Schedule

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Schedule monthly dependency updates
   - Test updates in development/staging before deploying to production

2. **Security Patches**
   - Apply critical security patches immediately
   - Schedule regular security audits

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor and optimize slow database queries
   - Review and optimize frontend performance quarterly

### Health Checks

1. **Automated Checks**
   - Implement automated health check endpoints
   - Configure monitoring to regularly ping these endpoints

2. **Manual Checks**
   - Schedule weekly review of monitoring dashboards
   - Perform monthly end-to-end testing of critical user flows

## Scaling Considerations

### Scaling Plan

1. **Database Scaling**
   - Monitor database performance and be prepared to upgrade Supabase plan
   - Document procedure for migrating to a larger database tier

2. **API Scaling**
   - Configure Railway auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
   - Document process for adding additional API instances

3. **Frontend Scaling**
   - Vercel automatically scales Next.js applications
   - Consider implementing CDN caching for static assets

### Load Testing

- Conduct periodic load testing to validate scaling assumptions
- Document the maximum users/requests the system can handle
- Plan for seasonal or event-based traffic spikes
